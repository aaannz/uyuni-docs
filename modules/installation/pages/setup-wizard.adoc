[[Setrup Wizard]]
= Setup Wizard

When you have completed your {productname} installation, you can use the setup wizard to complete the last few steps.
The setup wizard allows you to configure the HTTP proxy, organization credentials, and {suse} products.

The setup wizard is displayed by default when you log in the {productname} {webui} for the first time.
You can access the setup wizard directly by navigating to menu:Admin[Setup Wizard].



== Configure the HTTP Proxy

{productname} can connect to the {scc} or other remote servers using a proxy.
Navigate to the [guimenu]``HTTP Proxy`` tab to configure the proxy.

You will need to provide the hostname of the proxy.
Use the syntax ``<hostname>:<port>``.
For example: ``<example.com>:8080``.

You can disable use of the proxy by clearing the fields.



== Configure Organization Credentials

Your {scc} account is associated with the administration account of your organization.
You can share your {scc} access with other users within your organization.
Navigate to the [guimenu]``Organization Credentials`` tab to grant users within your organization access to your {scc} account.

Click btn:[Add a new credential], enter the username and password of the user to grant access to, and click btn:[Save].
A new credential card is shown for the user your have granted access to.

Use these buttons on the card to edit or revoke access.

* Check credential validation status (green tick or red cross icon).
To re-check the credential with SCC, click the icon.
* Set the primary credentials for inter-server synchronization (yellow star icon).
* List the subscriptions related to a certain credential (list icon).
* Edit the credential (pencil icon).
* Delete the credential (trash can icon).



== Configure Products

menu:Main Menu[Admin > SUSE Products]::
On the menu:Main Menu[Admin > SUSE Products] page, select product-specific channels you are entitled to.
+

+

The products displayed are directly linked to your organization credentials and your {suse} subscriptions.
Product extension and module lists are shown when you click the btn:[arrow] to the left of the product description.
This is a cascading mechanism and allows to unfold several levels according to the integration of the extensions and modules in the base product.
+

Products based on SUSE Linux Enterprise 15 or higher have a toggle button named btn:[include recommended].
When the toogle button is enabled on a base product, recommended extensions and modules are automatically selected for synchronization.
When the btn:[include recommended] button is enabled, you may uncheck product child channels you are not interested in syncing.
Recommended channels are labeled accordingly.
You cannot disable required channels.
+

If you click the menu:Channels[] icon in a row of a product, a popup lists the underlying channels (repositories) that build the product.
+

In the row above the product listing two filter options are available:

* Search by the product description. The filter limits the search to base products.
* Filter by architecture.
Click in the search field (or press kbd:[Enter] ) and then select from drop-down menu.
You can repeat this as often as necessary.
To remove an architecture either click the "`x`" symbol (or press kbd:[Backspace] ).
+

When you have made your selection(s), click btn:[Add products] in the upper right area.
This is equivalent to running [command]``mgr-sync add products`` or [command]``mgr-sync`` without any arguments.
+

View the synchronization progress in the status bar field to the right.
+

[NOTE]
.Synchronization Time
====
Channel synchronization will start and might take several hours.
When finished the corresponding channels can be used in {productname}.
====
+

[IMPORTANT]
.If Synchronization Fails
====
SUSE does not automatically trust 3rd party GPG keys.
If a reposync fails check if an untrusted GPG key is the cause by viewing the log files located in:

----
/var/log/rhn/reposync
----

Look for lines similar to the following:

----
['/usr/bin/spacewalk-repo-sync', '--channel', 'sle-12-sp1-ga-desktop-
nvidia-driver-x86_64', '--type', 'yum', '--non-interactive']
ChannelException: The GPG key for this repository is not part of the keyring.
Please run spacewalk-repo-sync in interactive mode to import it.
----
====
+

Alternatively, you can add listed channels immediately by clicking the btn:[Add this product] button in the status column.
A progress bar will be displayed.
The main product will expand, and then you may select add-on products belonging to the product that is currently added.
To overview required channels, select the list icon in the menu:SUSE Products[Channels] column.
Once a product has finished downloading, the status bar state will change from a filled percentage value to menu:SUSE Products[Finished].
